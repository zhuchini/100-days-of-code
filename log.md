##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Ruby on Rails article website.

**Thoughts**: Currently following instructions in creating an articles website, but my theme will be about dogs instead of lifestyle.

**Link(s) to work**: [Lifestyle Articles](https://www.notion.so/Lifestyle-articles-b82a5f10122b4cec924cd5d4a6cf7561)


### Day 2: June 9

**Today's Progress**: Implemented an alert feature from Bootstrap and made some final touches to the navbar.

**Thoughts**: I encountered so many errors by playing with the link_to and classes just to get a specific visual with Bootstrap.


### Day 3: June 10

**Today's Progress**: Googled how to implement card elements for the homepage.

**Thoughts**: I was not feeling the best today and was only able to take the most voted article to feature on the homepage.


### Day 4: June 11

**Today's Progress**: Navbar fully functional and tried to implement image overlay cards on homepage.

**Thoughts**: I copied the code from Bootstrap and the image would not show up. I tried writing in different ways, and still no success. It's possible is because of the image.


### Day 5: June 12

**Today's Progress**: Learned about SCSS in more detail.

**Thoughts**: Organized my SCSS stylesheet files and read a few articles on SCSS.


### Day 6: June 14

**Today's Progress**: Instead of working on my little article project, I went through the Javascript ES6 Challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It's a little bit difficult for me to understand recursion.


### Day 7: June 15

**Today's Progress**: Continued with ES6 Challenges from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: My motivation today was very low and I did the bare minimum. I do not like Destructuring Assignment because I think I'm used to Ruby and it's much easier.


### Day 8: June 16

**Today's Progress**: Currently at 50% of the ES6 Challenges from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I had to go back and check the JavaScript Curriculum on how to iterate. I am too familiar with Ruby itirations.


### Day 9: June 17

**Today's Progress**: Completed ES6, Regular Expressions, and Debugging from the JavaScript section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I followed the Pomodoro timer, and I had a productive day.


### Day 10: June 18

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic Data Structures from the JavaScript section of FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I hate multi-dimensional arrays, it confuses my eyes. The challenges were fairly easy, and I need more practice in writing functions.


### Day 11: June 19

**Today's Progress**: Completed Basic Algorithm Scripting from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I found it quite difficult and definitely need more practice.


### Day 12: June 21

**Today's Progress**: Completed Object Oriented Programming from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It was quite fun because I had an easier time understanding the concept. Looking forward to more!


### Day 13: June 22

**Today's Progress**: Completed Functional Programming

**Thoughts**: It helped me refresh on methods and writing functions. It was nice practice.
